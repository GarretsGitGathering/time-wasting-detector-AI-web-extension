# Chrome Extension with AI Time-Wasting Detection

A chrome extension that interacts with backend AI hosting servers to determine if a user is wasting their time on a browser. Currently, only the content determining AI is complete and it utilizes AI for determining the productivity rating of the webpage. It does this by taking inputs from html values of the webpage such as the title and some parsed data as well as taking a screenshot and processing the image.

Currently the project is still in development stages, currently it uses:

 - Chrome Extension Development
 - langchain API libraries
 - Gemini API libraries
