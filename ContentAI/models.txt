Certainly! Here's a list of regression models that you can research and consider for your project:

    Linear Regression: A basic and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

    Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): A linear regression model with regularization to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

    Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Another type of regularized linear regression that uses L1 regularization to encourage sparse coefficient estimates (some coefficients are exactly zero).

    ElasticNet Regression: A combination of Ridge and Lasso regression that applies both L1 and L2 regularization penalties.

    Decision Tree Regression: A non-linear regression model that predicts the target variable by partitioning the feature space into regions and assigning a constant value to each region.

    Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

    Gradient Boosting Regression: A boosting algorithm that builds an ensemble of weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones.

    Support Vector Regression (SVR): A regression model based on support vector machines that finds the hyperplane that best fits the data while minimizing deviations from the observed targets.

    Neural Network Regression: A regression model based on artificial neural networks, which can capture complex non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable.

    K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN): A non-parametric regression model that predicts the target variable by averaging the values of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Each of these regression models has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model depends on factors such as the complexity of the relationship between the input features and the target variable, the amount of available data, and computational resources. Experimenting with multiple models and comparing their performance on your dataset is often the best approach to find the most suitable regression model for your project.
